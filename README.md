# Weather App

## Overview

This Weather App is a simple yet effective tool for checking real-time weather conditions based on city names. Built with React and Vite, it provides users with an intuitive interface to search for weather information and view temperature, weather descriptions, humidity, and more.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: The background changes dynamically based on the temperature, providing a visual cue of the weather conditions.
  
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Users can search for weather information by entering city names. The application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to develop interactive UI components.

- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling. Vite offers fast development server, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds, enabling rapid development of modern web applications.

- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. It provides a utility-first approach to CSS, allowing developers to quickly build custom designs by applying pre-defined utility classes.
