## Components

### Navbar
The Navbar component displays the application title and the current number of items in the cart. It also provides navigation options to switch between the Shop and Cart views.

### Shop
The Shop component is responsible for rendering a list of products available for purchase. Each product is displayed as a Card component, which includes the product's image, title, author, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Users can click on the button to add the item to their cart.

### Cart
The Cart component displays the items that the user has added to their cart. It provides options to remove items from the cart, adjust the quantity of items, and view the total price of the cart.
